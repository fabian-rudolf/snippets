# Litter in Hamburg 2021-05-29 ([original post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6805056305137500160/))

Enjoying sunny days throughout loosened COVID-19 restrictions is liberating! However, the party crowd is also setting off a sharp increase in littering on the streets of Fischmarkt in Hamburg, Germany.
Those streets are meters away from the Elbe river, where lightweight single-use plastic litter can end up in and flow into the ocean, possibly harming marine wildlife populations and entering the human food chain on its way.
Meanwhile, public full to the brim trash cans complicate proper trash disposal.
Post COVID-19, will we attempt to learn from the current global health crisis and increase efforts in keeping our cities clean, or is our 2-year COVID-19 pandemic still at risk of being followed by a 500-year single-use plastic pandemic?
